 Quiz Application
This project aimed to create an interactive and engaging platform for users to test their knowledge on various topics. The application asks users multiple-choice or fill-in-the-blank questions on a specific topic. The application keeps track of scores, provide feedback on correct/incorrect answers, and offer a variety of questions to make it challenging and engaging.

Features:
1. The application starts by asking the name of user and a welcome note.
2. Then Rules and Guidelines are displayed on screen.
3. The app fetches random questions from a database, ensuring that each quiz session is unique and challenging. To make it convenient, I have used Pandas Library.
4. Users receive instant feedback on their answers and can track their scores throughout the quiz.
5. In the end, total score of user is displayed.
